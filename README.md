# FlashCards Starter Kit

FlashCards is a flashcard-style game that runs in your terminal. It features 30 cards with three potential answers each. You are prompted whether your answer is correct or incorrect.

## Purpose

This project serves an introduction to writing our own tests in the Chai assertion library and testing them in the Mocha testing framework.

## Setup

Clone this repo, open your terminal, and run the command `node index.js`. Use your arrow keys to select your answer and press enter to make your selection!
